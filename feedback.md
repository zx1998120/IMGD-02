# Feedback from Jessilyn Collette


Instructions from viewing image:
1. Create blue canvas
2. Create ellipse for forehead
3. Fill ellipse with skin color
4. Create multiple slightly different size rectangles stacked on top of each other under the
ellipse for face
5. Fill rectangles with skin color
6. Create trapezoid on right side of second lowest rectangle for lips
7. Flip trapezoid upside down
8. Fill trapezoid with pink color
9. Create two rounded rectangles with smaller thinner rectangles for sunglasses and fill
with color
10. Create highlight for sunglasses with transparency
11. Create rounded rectangle with transparency for text box
12. Fill text box with “cool”
The instructions given are pretty vague so I do not believe I would end up with the same image
if I had rendered them myself. Following the given instructions, I may end up creating a different
image with the same components which is interesting.
The rendered output makes sense looking at the code. I think it is interesting that it is mostly a
static image but the glare and “cool” text rely on the frame count to pop up
